# Epsilon Playground

This is a repository containing model-to-model transformation examples examples that can be run in the Epsilon Playground. These examples are defined in ETL and contain models, metamodels and transformations.

``examples.json`` contains a JSON script configuring all the examples and the files that store them.

You can use the [Epsilon Playground](https://eclipse.dev/epsilon/playground/?examples=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iNafey/epsilon-playground/main/examples.json) to run and fiddle with the examples from this repo.
