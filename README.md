# Epsilon Playground

This is a repository containing external examples that can be run in the Epsilon Playground. In particular, these examples are primarily based on ETL and each contain models, metamodels and transformations.

``examples.json`` contains a JSON script configuring all the examples and the files that store them.

Access [Epsilon Playground](https://eclipse.dev/epsilon/playground/?examples=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iNafey/epsilon-website/master/mkdocs/docs/playground/examples/examples.json) to play with the examples from this repo and much more.
